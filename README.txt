This was a class project for my data structures class. We had to read in .xml (examples
are ExampleXmlFiles folder) files, parse them and then do actions based on the actions 
listen in the xml file.  The end goal of this project was to store cities and roads in
a data structure known as a pmquadtree.  It was a simplified version of map quest.
